    "annualReport.2020.EDMessageTitle": "A Message from Our Executive Director",
    "annualReport.2020.EDMessageText1": "2020 was a transformational year around the world, and for Scratch. I joined the team in November, when we were months into the COVID-19 pandemic. With my background as an educational leader, I was excited about the potential of leading Scratch through a period of significant change and continuing to work toward my personal goal of helping students from all backgrounds reach new heights. I knew that in this challenging year, young people everywhere were in serious need of even more support to help them achieve their potential.",
    "annualReport.2020.EDMessageText2": "The inequitable structures we have built to educate children were exacerbated by the pandemic. Through our conversations with families and educators from around the world, we know that in 2020, kids from all communities needed creative learning opportunities to express their ideas and build their skills more than ever, even while many of them did not have the ability to go to school.",
    "annualReport.2020.EDMessageText3": "As the world adapted and approached creative learning and self expression in new ways, many educators, parents, and young people turned to Scratch. We saw 40% more Scratchers creating projects year over year, and Scratchers left 200% more comments in 2020 than in 2019. Young people from all around the world used Scratch as a place to connect, converse, collaborate, and engage with one another. We saw them discover the amazing things they could create when they were given the opportunity to think creatively and solve problems they were passionate about. ",
    "annualReport.2020.EDMessageText4": "In the wake of the pandemic, some have called for a “return to normal.” But for many young people, the freedom to learn and explore was missing in our schools well before COVID-19.",
    "annualReport.2020.EDMessagePullQuote": "We must do everything we can to change the systemic inequities in our educational systems, because “normal” was not built to be fair and equitable for most of our children.",
    "annualReport.2020.EDMessageText5": "In 2021, Scratch is redoubling our efforts to reach young people who have been historically excluded from creative computing and other creative learning opportunities. With support from Google.org, we’ve launched the Scratch Education Collaborative (SEC), a powerful network of organizations across the world focused on supporting these learners in developing their confidence in creative computing. The 41 organizations in year one of the new program will connect with and learn from the Scratch Team and one another, and develop Equity Toolkits that will support them as they grow and scale their support for the learners in their community.",
    "annualReport.2020.EDMessageText6": "Our work to make Scratch even more equitable and inclusive is far from over. I’m excited to share more with you in the coming months. Until then, I’d like to extend my sincere appreciation to the Scratch Community for continuing to support and care for each other through a turbulent year. Your creativity and compassion never ceases to inspire us.",

In the coming months, we’re working to bring Scratch into more schools, expand pathways to creative learning, develop and localize more resources for educators and young people, and improve the Scratch onboarding experience, and even more exciting projects.",
